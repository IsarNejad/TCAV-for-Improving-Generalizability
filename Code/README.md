To use the code base please follow these steps:

1.    Train a binary roberta-based classifier with [Wiki](https://github.com/IsarNejad/cross_dataset_toxicity) dataset and save it at /models/exp-Toxic-roberta. 
2.    Using the [data annotated for explicitness](https://github.com/IsarNejad/TCAV-for-Text-Classifiers/tree/main/Data), create the following text files. Each file include the text of tweets separated by double new lines.   
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - data/EA_dev_implicit.txt, data/EA_dev_explicit.txt, data/CH_implicit.txt, data/CH_explicit.txt
